# goTennaAndroid

I have spent 6.5 hours to finish this project. All of the requirements are compeleted without bugs. I implemented MapBox Map platform. This project is built based on MVP framework. I choosed retrofit2 for network request. To display list of information, i used recyclerview and corresponding adapter. Frequent sending network request is not a good thing for user and system itself, so i used SharedPreferences to store key-value data with file format. I also implement JUnit for unit testing. Before lunching application, i shrinked, optimized and obfuscated code via ProGuard. In XML part, i designed some dynamic effect such as clicking effect. I wrote some user permissions part cause higher version of SDK require adding user permission step. I also used GSON to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation, and vice versa. If I have enough time, i want to add some extra code to optimize my project, such as EventBus, ButterKnife, off-grid communicating functionality, location sharing fuctionality.
